# Changelog

All notable changes to Idep are documented here.  
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [Unreleased] — v0.0.7

### Planned
- Local embeddings pipeline (fastembed)
- Vector index + query (usearch)
- RAG context injection in chat

---

## [v0.0.6] — 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Tree-sitter AST chunking** for Rust, TypeScript, and Python with labeled spans and names
- `AstChunker` and `Chunk` types, integrated into indexer with AST-first chunking
- TypeScript/Python chunk extraction tests (functions, classes, interfaces, type aliases)
- Oversized chunk splitting with default max size (512 chars)

### Fixed
- Graceful fallback to naive line chunking for unsupported languages or parse failures
- Deterministic chunk naming propagation into CodeChunk

### Changed
- Indexer now uses AST chunking by default, with configurable fallback chunk size

---

## [v0.0.5] — 2026-03-19

### Added
- **LSP diagnostics**: `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` handling and per-document diagnostic storage with retrieval API
- **Hover support**: `textDocument/hover` request builder, response parsing, and plain-text extraction
- **Goto definition**: `textDocument/definition` builder and normalized `Location` list from `Location` / `LocationLink`
- WSL URI normalization applied consistently for all textDocument requests and diagnostics storage
- Integration tests for Rust Analyzer: completions, hover, goto-definition, and diagnostics

### Fixed
- Normalized diagnostic URI lookups to avoid client/server URI format mismatches (WSL path forms)
- Cleared stale diagnostics on `didClose` and added regression tests
- Added backend timeout guard for integration notification polling to avoid indefinite hangs

### Changed
- `DocumentManager` now routes all provider URIs through `to_server_uri()` before sending and querying
- `LspClient` hover text helper returns plain text for `MarkupContent` and `MarkedString` variants
- Completed all v0.0.5 TODO milestones in `TODO.md`

---

## [v0.0.4] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **LSP document synchronization**: `didOpen`, `didChange`, `didSave`, `didClose` notifications
- **LSP completions**: `textDocument/completion` request builder with full round-trip support
- `CompletionParams` construction with URI, position, and context
- Completion response parsing for `CompletionList` and `CompletionItem[]`
- `Buffer::apply_completion()` with `textEdit` range handling (delete range before insert)
- `Buffer::apply_text_edit()` for proper LSP range replacement
- Completion ranking: sort by `sort_text` (server intent), then label length, deterministic deduplication via `BTreeMap`
- `completion.rs` module for bridging LSP results to buffer
- rust-analyzer integration test for real completion requests
- Document sync test with Python mock server (gated by python3 availability)

### Fixed
- **textEdit range bug**: Completions now properly delete the specified range before inserting, preventing doubled text (e.g., "fn fo" + "fn foo" → "fn foo")
- Dead code shadow in `update_cursor` (removed variable re-declaration)
- Cursor positioning: clamp to last character index (line_len - 1), accounting for trailing newlines

### Changed
- Moved `rank_completions` from `LspClient` to `completion.rs` module (better organization)
- Completion ranking now respects `sort_text` field per LSP spec
- Updated Claude workflow to use `claude-code-action@v1` with custom prompt and model settings
- Expanded `CLAUDE.md` with full SDLC coverage, SemVer guidance, and deployment context

---

## [v0.0.3] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- LSP client lifecycle: spawn, shutdown, restart with backoff, stderr capture
- JSON-RPC transport over stdio with Content-Length framing, pending-response tracking, and notification broadcast
- Initialize handshake helper with stored `InitializeResult` and client capabilities
- WSL2 path normalization utilities (Windows ↔ `/mnt/<drive>`), plus round-trip tests and env-gated rust-analyzer integration scaffold
- CI installs `rust-analyzer` component; initialize→shutdown sequence test

### Changed
- rust-analyzer integration test now env-gated (`RUN_RA_INT=1`) instead of ignored

---

## [v0.0.2] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- `CompletionEngine` with FIM-aware prompt construction and stop-sequence truncation
- FIM token support: DeepSeek, StarCoder, CodeLlama variants with model-specific stop sequences
- DeepSeek stop sequences: `}\n`, `<｜fim▁end｜>`, `<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`
- `FimTokens::for_model()` — auto-select FIM tokens based on model name
- Debounce logic with `CancellationToken` (configurable, default 300ms) in `CompletionHandler` and `ChatSession`
- Stop-sequence truncation via `truncate_on_stop()` (post-processing fallback)
- Streaming token callback on `ChatSession::send_streaming()`
- `Buffer::insert`, `Buffer::delete`, `Buffer::lines`, `Buffer::Display` trait
- Cursor position tracking in `Buffer`
- `Workspace::open_file`, `Workspace::save_file`
- File watcher with `notify-debouncer-mini` (100ms debounce)
- Unit tests for all buffer operations
- Live FIM completion integration test (`#[ignore]` — run with `cargo test -- --ignored`)
- `CompletionItem::label` truncation to first line for LSP menu rendering

### Fixed
- Ollama backend: `raw: true` to bypass chat template and preserve FIM tokens
- Ollama backend: `temperature: 0.0` for deterministic code completions
- `Buffer::lines()` strips trailing newlines (editor API convention)
- File watcher debounce prevents rapid-fire reindex on save
- Claude workflow: use `jq --rawfile` for prompt/diff to prevent injection

### Changed
- `ChatSession::send()` → `ChatSession::send_streaming()` with token callback
- `Buffer::to_string()` replaced with `Display` trait implementation
